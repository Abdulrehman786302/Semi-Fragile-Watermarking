# Semi-Fragile-Watermarking
What is semi-fragile watermarking:Ability to resist unintentional manipulations caused by common image processing operations like adding noise, changing brightness, JPEG compression Fragile against intentional, malicious manipulations.
The local binary pattern (LBP) operator was proposed to measure the local contrast in texture analysis. It has been successfully applied to visual inspection. The LBP operator is defined in a circular local neighborhood. Using the center pixel as the threshold, its circularly symmetric P neighbors within a certain radii R are individually labeled as 1 when the value is larger than the center, or labeled as 0 when the value is smaller than the center.
